 * This header file contains items relating to the tabs subsystem
 *
 * Tabs that reference character position are stored zero-based,
 * but the T-tabset command addresses the first tab as tab 1.
 * The value stored in a character position tab is also zero-based,
 * but the actual tab characters present them as 1-based,
 * i.e. the first character in a line is column 1.
 * Thus the command "t 36" sets tabs[0].value to 35,
 * keying a tab then skipping to column 36.
 * The ALU sees their internal representation however.
