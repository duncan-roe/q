While editing or inputting a command, changes all alphabetic characters
logically to the right of the cursor (i.e. from the cursor on) to upper case if
they were not in upper case already.
 At other times (e.g. when printing lines), ^S has its usual 'stop output'
effect providing XOFF was enabled at the time Q was invoked.
