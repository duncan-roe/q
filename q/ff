          \/ F F - F O R T R A N - E Y E - V I E W \/

Tells the editor that only the first part of any multipart line should be
displayed during Print or View commands. This guarantees that V or P23 will not
overflow a conventional 24-line screen.

Parameter
 <yes/no arg> one of 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false', 'on', 'off' with the obvious
              meanings. Optional - if not specified the current state is
              inverted.

Notes
 Because the display width is 72 characters, FF effectively gives a "FTN eye
view" of a file in most cases, since the FTN compiler only acts on the contents
of cc 1 - 72. However, 72-character lines that contain characters which the
Editor takes more than 1 character position to display will not be shown in
their entirety. Lines containing such characters (eg ^, displayed as ^*) will
still not cause screen overflows, but what the user sees under the action of FF
will not be what the FTN compiler sees.
