INTRODUCTION
============

This README describes how to debug Q macros using gdb.
I originally planned to incorporate a macro debugger inside Q, but have shelved
that in favour of using gdb.

The example that follows debugs the ^N^A macro in ../help/word.qm. This is the
macro that aligns text to fit inside tab 2. It starts the most complex macro
program in the Q distribution.

PREPARATION
===========

Be sure to have read and become familiar README_DEBUG before reading on.
In addition to the 2 terminal sessions mentioned there, you will likely want
a session where you can peruse the currently loaded macro table. But in
general you won't need another terminal session in which to examine source.

To get a current macro table: issue the ggo command below. In the session where
Q is running, use the Newmacro command to dump the table in a file, e.g. "n- t5"
to create a file called "t5" in the directory where you are running gdb
(usually this one). You can dump the macro table to any file you like of course,
but the following narrative assumes you used t5.
In the 3rd session, enter "less t5" and you have the macro table. (You might
prefer "less t5 ../help/word.qm" since there are extra comments in word.qm).

The ^N^A macro is defined on the line starting "N A ..." in word.qm.
It shows up in t5 as macro 1 on line 1 starting "n 001 ...".
The gdb session always reports macros by number, as they are listed in t5.

The file ./macro_debug_sample exercises the ^N^A macro suite.
Either "export j=macro_debug_sample" before running ggo or enter
"q macro_debug_sample" in the Q session.
(If you are interested in some other file, use that file instead).

RUN A SESSION
=== = =======

Using the COMMAND TEMPLATES below, export variables and issue the ggo command.
Q will start in your debug window. Optionally, set up your macro table window as
per PREPARATION above.

In the debug window, enter "v" to view the file you are working on. If it's
empty (so you didn't export j as the file to edit) you can edit the file now by
entering "q macro_debug_sample".

START DEBUGGING
===== =========

In the debug window, type Control-N followed by Control-A (^N^A).
Observe in the gdb window there is the new message "starting macro$1 = 01".
"$1 = " is an artifact of gdb which I couldn't eliminate - try to ignore it and
read the message as "starting macro 01".
This is what you would hope to see after typing ^N^A.

In the gdb window, since the previous gdb command was "c" (short for "continue")
you can now touch <Enter> to continue on to the next macro.
Observe the next message "starting macro$2 = 01001". This corresponds to the
macro code
  n 001 ^NC^NS^N\^ND^N^<1001>
at the start of t5.

For those unfamiliar with Q macro coding: ^N^<1001> is a jump to macro 1001.
The ^ND immediately before it pushes a link to Q's macro stack so that the 1001
macro (hereinafter referred to as N1001) can return to the next character in
N001. It does this using the sequence ^NU.
N and U are what is called "pseudomacros": they are invoked with ^N as if they
were macros but perform some function implemented in Q's code instead.
The pseudomacro name "D" stands for "Down" and "U" stands for "Up" (c/w Call /
Return).
For more information about pseudomacros, enter the Q command "h pm", but NOT NOW
- you're in he middle of debugging a macro ;)

In the debug window, touch <Enter> to continue on to the next macro. You see
N001 being resumed. This tells you that N1001 or some macro it jumped to has
issued ^NU.

Before moving on, take a look at the definition of N1001: in the "less t5"
screen, the search sequence "/^n 1001" will get you to it (that's uparrow
small-n, not Control-N).
Observe that N1001 called N4000 but gdb didn't tell us that. Macros in the low
04000's are what is called "active pseudomacros" or "active pseodos". Their
actions are also documented in "h pm" (NOT NOW...:).
Unlike regular pseudomacros, active pseudos execute the action of ^NU on
completion so can be called using ^ND.
The ggo command template below assumes you don't want to see calls to
pseudomacros (you wouldn't see returns from them anyway) by the gdb command
  cond 2 (thisch < 0101 || thisch > 0132) && thisch < 04000
The ALU opcodes occupy the higher part of the 04000 range and it's possible you
might want to debug them, but that's outside the scope of this README.

MAIN DEBUG LOOP
==== ===== ====

Again touch <Enter> in the debug window. You see N701 starting:
  n 701 ^J^NC^NU^NA^N^<706>^NG>^N^<700>^N^<702> ;Leave lines starting "> " alone
N701 has an inline comment (it's part of the macro but never gets executed due
to the unconditional jump to N702 before it).

You can see N701 can jump to any of N706, N700 or N702. Telling us which this
and other macros jump to is the main objective of the debug session.

<Enter> shows that N701 jumps to N702 in this instance. Line 1 of the sample
file was not empty and did not start with "> " (assumed quoted email line).

In fact line 1 is a single word of length > desired maximum line length. This
line is left unaltered, as we will see next.

N702 sets the cursor position according to whether line length is more than
desired maximum (as determined by putting cursor at last character in line and
seeing whether it is past tab 2).
  n 702 ^Z^Y^NP2^H^F^F^N^<704>
  ^NP2 obeys next 2 chars iff cursor is past tab 2 as it will be
On a short line, it leaves the cursor at line end (after the last character).
On a long line, it leaves the cursor on the first character of the 3rd word in
the line. If there are < 3 words in the line, the cursor will also be at line
end (^F[word forward] has no effect at line end (unlike ^X[character forward]
which adds a space)).

N702 now jumps to N704, which is a looping macro
  n 704 ^NA^NS^Y^@^NP2^N^<705>^NA^N^<707>^F^F^N^@
  The jump to macro zero (^@) at macro end is a jump to the current macro.
    It could be coded as ^N^<704> but that would have to be changed if the macro
    were to be renumbered whereas ^N^@ would keep working as before.
N704 leaves the cursor at line end if that's where it is, otherwise moves it
back one character (because it will be on the first character of a word and the
program wants it on the preceding space).
If the cursor is now after tab 2, jump to N705.

<Enter> indeed shows a jump to N705
  n 705 ^B^NP1^NS^N^<701>^?^T^N^<702>
  N001 set tab 1 to 1 so ^NP1 is true unless cursor is at line start
N705 is entered when the cursor was past tab 2. It either splits the line at the
preceding word boundary or, if there is only a single word in the line, lets the
line stay as-is.
After ^B[word back] cursor is at line start: ^NP1[cursor past tab 1] is false
so don'r obey ^NS[skip 2] and jump no N701.

<Enter> confirms jump to N701
  n 701 ^J^NC^NU^NA^N^<706>^NG>^N^<700>^N^<702>

<Enter> again to execute N701. Observe line 1 appears in the Q window, owing to
the ^J at the start of N701.

ENDING THE SESSION EARLY
====== === ======= =====

Of course, you can simple enter "q" in the gdb window.

Instead, if you want to leave the session running but skip the rest of the
currently debugged macro, enter "disa" to disable breakpoints. Then "c" will
get you the Q prompt.

COMMAND TEMPLATES
======= =========

export my_pty as the tty as in README_DEBUG
export j as the file to edit (if you have one)(e.g. export j=macro_debug_sample)
export k as the rc file with which q should start
  (defaults to ../help/.qrc which eventually loads ../help/word.qm).
n- t5
less t5 ../help/word.qm
sleep 100000
