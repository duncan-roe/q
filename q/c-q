While editing or inputting a command, changes all alphabetic characters
logically to the right of the cursor (i.e. from the cursor on) to lower case if
they were not in lower case already.
 At other times (e.g. when printing lines), ^Q has its usual 'continue output'
effect providing XOFF was enabled at the time Q was invoked.
