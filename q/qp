When run in a pipe, Q must have a -i[nitial FI command] argument to tell it what
to do, since it cannot take any input from the terminal (if there is one).

The -i need not contain a S[ave] or Q[uit], because these are done automatically
on reaching the end of the -i_defined macro.

Q buffers the entire pipe contents in a temporary file before starting, and only
sends the contents of that file onward through the pipe when it has finished.

By default, only errors are sent to stderr. The -v[erbose] argument causes
normal Q output to go to stderr also

Examples:-

>20:54:18$  echo aaa|q -i'y a b^J'|cat
> bbb

> 20:54:18$ echo aaa|q -v -i'y a b^J'|cat
