Moves the screen cursor forward to the next occurrence in the line of the next
character input. No effect if at end of line. Can be given with the same
character following several times in succession as the character immediately
after (at) the cursor is not included in the search. However it will usually be
found more convenient to use ^^ for this function - 'H C_UP' for more details.
The cursor moves to the end of the line if the character is not found.
