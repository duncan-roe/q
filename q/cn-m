  << ^ N M - D E F I N E   M A C R O >>
 Sets the macro indicated by the following character in the macro (which must
be there and be a valid macro i.d.) to the current line being edited or command
being input.Works whether in command mode or editing a line. Error sequence
(bell &c.) if the current line is too big for a macro (64 chars max at JUL
'81). If there is room for 2 extra chars, ^NU is added to the macro definition,
so you don't have to do it yourself.
 This very powerful pseudo-macro provides the feedback link from the data you
are editing back to your editing instructions. Typically you find a line with
the data you want, throw away the rest of the line, make the macro then ^[
(ESC) out of the line so it goes back to its original state.
 Example: suppose you have 'found' an "FD" line in a COBOL program, and now you
want to remember the name of the file being defined (to put in the "VALUE OF
FILE-ID" perhaps). After the L-LOCATE, the cursor will be on the "F" of "FD".
 N A '^F^L^G ^K^NM^B^[^NU
 Call this macro by ^ND^N^A. How it works:
 Forward to the word we want                               ^F
 Throw away 1st part of line                               ^L
 Forward to 1st char we don't want or end of line          ^G<space>
 Throw away rest of line                                   ^K
 Define macro ^N^B as the name + ^NU  ** EXAMPLE **        ^NM^B
 ESCAPE to restore the line and exit                       ^[^NU
 If line had been "FD PRYNT LABEL ..."  ^N^B would now be "PRYNT^NU".
