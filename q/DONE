workfile.c, readfl.c & maybe others to have #pragma to turn off optimising
Do not visbell more than once every 1/10 sec
Add ~/bin/qm (list macros) to make install
Create man page for qm
q -v to not action FD Y (Changed to q -vv)
FB to use clock_gettime (replaces gettimeofday) for 1/5 second interval
FReprompt command to bring up q command line from w/in macro:
	Q continues macro; FQ abandons
	(Renamed from FRecurse)
Do Delete properly (i.e. entirely inside workfile.c)
INTERNALS
	Fix runindent label squashes
	More GIVE_UP macros - use error_exit as standard label
	rework asg2 blocks (including xistcs.c)
	Use meaningful names instead of logtmp &c.
	Tidy scmnrd.c in particular
	return bad_rdtk() once H & L are subroutinised
	Eliminate FTN COMMON in favour of extern / instantiate
	Re-organise q.c for static fns at end
	Maybe re-organise q.c for no internal fns

-- v55
New read-only ALU Q register for return values from Q
2 active pseudos to run a shell command and receive stdout/stderr (backtick)
	e.g. if n4014 & n4015
	n4014 {shell command} or n4015 {shell command}
	^ND^N^<4014> returns stdout (minus final Nl)
	^ND^N^<4015> returns stderr (minus final Nl)
	^NM^<4014> (or <4015>) as above
	If defined as n4014, error in cmd => error in macro
	If defined as n4015, command status returned in Q (0=good):
		macro continues
	Update HELP
	Update man page(s)
New basic pseudo ^NW<macro id> return length of macro in Q; -1 if undefined
Can test if a macro is defined: (done by ^NW)
