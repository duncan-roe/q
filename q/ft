  \/ F T - T O K E N   N O N - D E L I M I T E R \/

Tells the editor that the specified character is not to be treated as a token
delimiter in the token-sensitive commands FL, FY, &c.

Format
 FT <char>

Parameter
 A single character to be added to the non-delimiter table.

Notes
 There is a limit to the size of the non-delimiter table, but it is reasonably
large. Alphanumerics should not be specified as they are not delimiters in the
first place. In the intial implementation it is not possible to remove
characters from the non-delimiter table except by quitting out of Q and
starting again. Also the current table cannot be listed: FT with no parameters
will do this once it's implemented. For more notes and some examples of use,
type "H FL".
