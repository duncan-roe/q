Tells the editor that searches for strings should be performed in a case-
independent manner. This affects the L, Y, FL and FY commands.

Parameter
 <yes/no arg> one of 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false', 'on', 'off' with the obvious
              meanings. Optional - if not specified the current state is
              inverted.

Notes
 Although strings to be located / replaced are searched for in a case-
independent manner, replacement strings are of course still inserted in
whatever case the user specifies.
