  \/ K - S T A R T   A	 S H E L L \/

The terminal is returned to its state before calling Q (e.g. ICANON in Unix),
then a shell is started so that shell commands may be entered. When done, Q can
be restarted by exiting the shell.

If you only want to issue a few commands you may find it preferable to issue
them via Q's own ! or FP command, which allows you to screenedit them if they
were wrong.

Parameters: none
