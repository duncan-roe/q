  \/ F N - F N O N E \/

Sets the output level on macros &c. to a zero.

Parameters: none

 See FV for the default output level. When NONE mode is activated during a long
macro or the Y command nothing appears at all until the macro or command has
finished. Certain error messages which scmacros can be (but may not have been!)
written to detect are suppressed e.g. "string not found" from Locate or "line #
off end of file" from Modify. These errors could be detected by the ^NC
pseudomacro because after such an error the editor is left in command mode
whilst otherwise it would be in edit mode.
