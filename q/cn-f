  << ^ N F - R E M E M B E R   F I L E   P O S I T I O N >>

 Sets the tab indicated by the following character in the macro (which must be
there and be a valid tab i.d.) to the current file position. Type 'H AS' for a
list of the valid tab id's. Type 'H FPOS' for more details on file position.
 Notes
 See note with ^N[ ('H CN-LHB') regarding which tabs may be used.
 When modifying a line, the file position has already moved to be before the
next line (i.e. after that line). Thus whether you set position while in the
line or in command mode immediately afterwards makes no difference. To get back
into the line, you have to reset file position using ^NN then MODIFY -1, not
MODIFY -.
