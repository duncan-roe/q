This is a long line which will get split into 2 so length doesn't exceed tab 2 (at column 81, so line length is 80 chars max).

(The above line is intentionally blank).
Next line starts w/space so no join to this one.
 This line & the next will be
joined and re-split because of being too long after the join.
> This line is email-quoted so will be left alone
Try to remember to quit Q w/out saving!
