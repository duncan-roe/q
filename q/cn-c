  << ^ N C - O B E Y   I F   I N   A   C O M M A N D >>

 This is another simple conditional pseudo-macro like ^NA, but the condition
tested is different. The next 2 characters (there must be at least 2 more) in
the macro are obeyed if the macro is invoked when Q is reading a command,
otherwise they are skipped.
 Some typical uses
 ^NC can be used to detect a failed L-LOCATE e.g.
 N A 'L FRED^J^NC^N^BJIM^D^J^N^D
 This looks for 'FRED'. If it's not found, we'll still be in command mode after
the LOCATE command so we'll branch to macro ^B. Otherwise, replace 'FRE' with
'JIM' & delete the 'D' then go to macro ^D.
 Another use - this macro inserts a string at the front of as many lines as we
specify, and should be used after say an 'M x y' command where x is the 1st
line to have the string inserted and we want to do it for y lines.
 N A '^NC^NU^EA STRING^J^N^A
 Operation: if in command mode, then exit. Otherwise turn on inserting, put in
'A STRING', accept the line, and do it all again.
