  >< R - C A R R I A G E   R E T U R N ><

In the very unlikely event that c/r (015) does not return the cursor to pos'n 1
in the current line, this command tells the editor what, if anything, does.
Multiple backspaces are used if c/r is unavailable, but c/r n/l, to get to the
start of the next line, is assumed to work.

Format
 R <no. of chars> <char1>,<char2>
 Parameters are as for the "A" characteristic ("H X-A") except there are no
implied backspaces so <# chars> can only be 0,1 or 2.

Note
 The effect of telling the editor there is no backspace and no c/r (i.e. no way
to move the cursor back) is undefined.

Example
 R 1 215 /* Set "c/r" as the return char (the default).
