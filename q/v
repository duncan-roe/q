  \/ V - V I E W \/

Displays an area of the file around the current file position at the terminal.
The current line is always displayed, plus the specified number of lines before
and after it.

Parameter
 <# lines> As above. May be specified as zero, in which case only the current
	   line is displayed. Optional - if not specified then V always prints
	   enough lines to fill the screen if the file is big enough (with the
	   same number before and after the current line, if this is not close
	   to the start or end of the file). Use Control-P or key any character
	   to stop printing early, if required.

File position
 Unaltered.
