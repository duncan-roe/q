Sets the output level on macros &c. to a bare minimum.

Parameters: none

 See FV for the default output level. When brief mode is activated during a
long macro or the Y command, the line number being dealt with is displayed but
without a newline so the display remains stationary and the line # just turns
over like a counter. Certain error messages which scmacros can be (but may not
have been!) written to detect are suppressed e.g. "string not found" from
Locate or "line # off end of file" from Modify. These errors could be detected
by the ^NC pseudomacro because after such an error the editor is left in
command mode whilst otherwise it would be in edit mode.
