  <> ^ W - C H A R   F O L L O W I N G   N O   P A R I T Y <>

After ^W, the next character typed is entered into the current line
unconditionally, as is the case with ^P, but with the parity bit high.

Note
 To distinguish these from normal (parity low) characters in the file,
characters thus inserted are displayed as '^<<octal value>>'. This display
format is legal as input to the N-ewmacro and FI-mmediate_macro commands, for
any character.
