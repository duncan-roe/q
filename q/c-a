  <> ^ A - A G A I N / A P P E N D <>

Moves the cursor to the end of the current line, then, if the previous line was
longer than this, the remainder of the previous line is recalled and the cursor
left after that.

Notes
 The PREVIOUS line is the last line accepted either by n/l or ^T. There are
seperate COMMAND and WORKFILE PREVIOUS lines.
 The previous line can be recalled any number of times while editing a line
e.g. after a ^U.
 ^A will not recall a line that was accidentally ESCape'd. Type 'H C-R' for how
to do this.
