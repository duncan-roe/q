  <> ^ ^ - R E P E A T   L A S T   ^ G  <>

Moves the screen cursor forward to the next occurrence in the line of the last
character successfully searched for by a ^G. No effect if at end of line. Rings
bell (error) if no successful ^G on this line yet. Can be used several times in
succession as the character immediately after (at) the cursor is not included
in the search.

Special Uses
 Can be used to get to a PREVIOUS occurrence of the currently nominated
character by moving the cursor backwards (e.g. with ^H) then reissuing ^^ as
required.
