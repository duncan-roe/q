On a terminal with Q not inserting characters, the cursor will share a screen
position with a character of data. However Q always regards the cursor as being
between two characters, namely the character just mentioned and the one before
it. This can be seen when insert mode is entered, as the character that was
sharing the cursor position moves one place to the right. Hence the control
command-characters that operate on chars to the "right" of the cursor also work
on the character sharing the cursor position on the screen: similarly, controls
working on characters to the "left" of the cursor do not operate on this
character.
 Sometimes the cursor is said to be "at" a character - the character mentioned
in the last paragraph is intended by this whether it occupies a seperate
position on the screen (as will be the case when inserting) or not.
 Note that the 1st character on a line is character # 1.
