  \/ F X - F X C H A N G E \/

Exchanges the functions of any two keyboard keys.

Formats
 FXCHANGE <1st key>,<2nd key>
 FXCHANGE

Parameters
 <1st key> \ The 2 keys whose functions
 <2nd key> / are to be interchanged.

 If one key is specified, the other must be also. Control characters can be
entered as ^A, &c. ^? stands for RUBOUT, and either ^ or ^* are accepted for ^.
The command only affects chars typed from the keyboard:- U-Use files and macros
are not affected. FX may be used to cater better for individual preference.
Examples include swapping ^H and DEL, although in an xterm you may prefer to
select "Delete is DEL" from the terminal menu.
 If the command has no parameters, a dialogue takes place for certain special
functions, such as resetting all keys to their defaults again.
