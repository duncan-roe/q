  << ^ N J - L O N G   J U M P >>

Jumps by the arbitrary number of chars which is the value of the next
character. A backwards jump may be effected by specifying 16-bit 2's-complement
e.g. ^<177777> is -1 (but you would never use -1, read on).

Because this is a 3-character sequence, ^NL will be required to conditionally
obey it. The 4th character position is therefore lost, since either the ^NL or
the ^NJ will skip it. Conventionally such positions are coded with an X
(Capital "X").

The skip is done relative to the character following the macro (i.e. the X
mentioned previously). Thus a backwards jump of 1, 2 or 3 characters will end
up in the ^NJ sequence again. For example:-

...^NL^NJ^<06>X^[m-2^J...

conditionally obeys the 5-character sequence  starting with ^[ (assuming ^NL
was preceded by a conditional like ^NA).

Specify numeric 6 as ^<06>m since ^<6> will probably acquire the meaning of
"extended-parity 6".
