Gets the character string to get the cursor to end-of-line (e.g. column 80 on a
traditional VDU). Q never displays a character in this column, because of
possible wraparound, but it may wish to leave the cursor there. The default
method is to get to the start of the current line, backspace to the end of the
previous line, then linefeed. This works for most modern ASYNC terminals, which
generally 'wrap back' from start of line on a backspace. However the VT100
didn't, so now neither do X-windows nor Linux consoles &c.

Therefore there is a second default method for these terminals, which involves
doing a Cr (to get to column 1) then using an escape sequence to move the
cursor forward to the last column. Q tries to guess which method to use: if it
can determine the screen size and that size is not 80 x 24, then VT100 is used,
else the old default is used.

Format
 A <no. of chars>,<char1>,...
 <# chars> total # of chars to get to cc80 (includes any # of backspaces, which
	   are done after <char1>ff. Optional - may be specified as 0 or
	   ommitted (0 assumed). 0 => there is no fast get to eol available.
 <char1>ff The octal char(s) to get the cursor to a defined point (usually cc80
	   of this line - if #chars is not exhausted then do extra backspaces).
	   Single characters stand for themselves - octal numbers must
	   therefore be specified with at least 2 digits.

Examples
 A	      /* Terminal with no fast eol sequence - can only refresh forward
 A 3,15,10,12 /* The default, described earlier.
 A 1,1	      /* A terminal where ^A gets to cc80.
 A 6 015 033 [ 7 9 C /* VT100 sequence for 80-column terminal
