When debugging Q, I find it easiest to have gdb running in 1 terminal session
with all of q's input and output going to and coming from another. Also I use
"ggo" from the "command_line_tools" repository adjacent to that for Q.

In the session that is to act as Q's display, do the following:

> 22:10:13$ ps
>   PID TTY          TIME CMD
>  2385 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
>  4606 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
> 13:05:42$ sleep 10000

Note the pts number returned by the ps command. Issue the sleep command to stop
the shell from grabbing input.

In the session where you want to run gdb, do the following (substituting the
relevant pts number)(only 1 line of typing):

> 13:14:56$ ggo q -a '</dev/pts/0 >/dev/pts/0 2>&1' c
> spawn gdb -n

Insert any breakpoints you want set initially before the trailing "c" in the ggo
command. The trailing "c" is itself a gdb command to continue after hitting the
breakpoint which ggo always sets at "main".

To interrupt Q / gdb, enter ^C *in the gdb session*. Do NOT enter ^C in the Q
display session: it will have no effect on Q but it WILL terminate sleep.

When you have finished debugging, enter ^C in the Q display window to obtain the
shell prompt again:

> 13:05:42$ sleep 10000
>
> Type H for help
> Noted screen dimensions 177 x 71
> > u .qrc
> > fd y /* ************************ C ************************
> > q
> ^C
> 13:43:30$
Handy template (set i first):

ggo q -a "</dev/pts/$i >/dev/pts/$i 2>&1" c
