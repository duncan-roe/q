The syntax of a Q command line is a command verb followed by an argument list
terminated by end of line or unquoted '/*' comment delimiter.
 Argument delimiters are space, comma, '/*' or newline but the first three can
be part of a parameter by enclosing in single quotes.
 Single quotes intended as part of a parameter must be paired. Commands are
case-insensitive (but their arguments may not be). Comment lines starting '* '
are also accepted.

Additionally
 Command verbs may be abbreviated to any unique abbreviation up to their full
lengths; currently all have 1-character unique abbreviations except those
starting 'F' which need 1 following character.
 A non-alphabetic 1st parameter will be split-off automatically from the command
verb providing it does not contain quoted parts or quote pairs. Thus, for
instance, "P23" will be interpreted as "P 23" - in fact , the latter will
replace the former on the screen after newline is keyed.
 Numbers can start with a leading plus (+) sign as well as minus (-). This has
special significance if the number if a line number - key 'H L#' for more
details.
