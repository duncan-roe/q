When you need to debug Q running as a pipe, you don't need the second screen.
The template below is enough to debug the pipe mechanism.
You will always want to set brakpoints, because there is no user interaction
with Q running in a pipe.
Q wil always need a "-i" (initial command) argument.
The one below is trivial: if you have a specific use case then you would want to
replace it and likely also provide your own input file.

Q does not insist that its input and output files are pipes:
regular files are fine.

The file "xxx" is provided as input.
The command below uses that and creates the file /tmp/yyy.

ggo q -a "-iy,x,y^J <xxx >/tmp/yyy"
