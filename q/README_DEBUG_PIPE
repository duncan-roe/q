When you need to debug Q running as a pipe, you don't need the second screen,
*unless* the macros you will be running may use FR-FREPROMPT.
The template below is enough to debug the pipe mechanism.
You will always want to set breakpoints, because there is no user interaction
with Q running in a pipe (FR excepted).
Q will always need a "-i" (initial command) argument.
The one below is trivial: if you have a specific use case then you would want to
replace it and likely also provide your own input file.

Q does not insist that its input and output files are pipes:
regular files are fine.

The file "xxx" is provided as input.
The command below uses that and creates the file /tmp/yyy.

ggdb -a "-iy,x,y^J <xxx >/tmp/yyy" q
