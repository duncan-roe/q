  << ^ N L - L O N G   S K I P >>

 Because it takes 4 characters to call a macro as a subroutine
(^ND^N<macro-id>) it is necessary, to call a subroutine conditionally, to have
a 4-character skip. like ^NS, this reverses the sense of the conditional, so if
you didn't want to do that, precede ^NL with ^NS.
 Example
 Macro ^A calls macro ^B as a subroutine if in command mode, otherwise signals
an error:
 N A '^NC^NS^NL^ND^N^B^N\
