  <> ^ R - R E S C U E <>

Makes available characters in the current line up to the longest the line has
ever been since starting on this line. Thus it can undo an accidental ^U for
instance. If the line is a fresh line that has never had any characters at all
(apart from posibly the indent) then characters are made available up to the
maximum possible line length - currently (Oct '80) 80 chars for a command or
500 chars for a line of data. This provides a means of recovering from an
accidental ESCape.

Special Uses
 ^R can be used to generate a copy of a line next to itself (e.g. to eventually
interchange 2 fields). Just insert spaces at the front of the line until the
line's length has doubled, ^L then ^R.
 However, to interchange fields you might well find it easiest to split the
line (^T) so that the fields are on seperate lines, then amend their order
using R-REPOSITION then J-JOIN them. To get a copy side by side you could in
fact use C-COPY & J-JOIN as an alternative to the previous paragraph.
