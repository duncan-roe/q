  \/ Q - Q U I T \/

Stops editing the current file, and quits the program if no parameter given.
The command is queried if the file has been modified since the last SAVE or
BACKUP. When quitting the program, the terminal is returned to its state before
 Q was entered.

Exceptions: "q -A" and "q -V" act as from the shell command-line (see "H IQ").
            Q outputs the requested information and continues.

If Q is not given a parameter, it may be "massaged" to have one, if the Q editor
was initially invoked with multiple file arguments (perhaps with a wildcard).
In this case, the next argument is massaged in, so Q only actually quits after
the last nominated file has been edited. In a macro, Q never quits unless
"FM +Q" has been issued previously, see "H FM"

Parameter
 <pathname> Optional. If specified or massaged in, Q does not quit the program,
            instead it initialises its workfile and reads in the specified file
            which becomes the file being edited, in that a subsequent SAVE or
            BACKUP without a parameter will use <pathname> as the implied one.
            Macro definitions and terminal characteristics (such as the setting
            of indent mode) are preserved however. The command 'Q <pathname>'
            is therefore always faster than the equivalent sequence 'Q;Q
            <pathname>' and is usually considerably faster.
 $<number> May be given alternatively to <pathname> and is massaged into one of
           the original command line arguments. If zero, becomes the current
           command-line arg. If signed, reference argument <number> before or
           after the current one. Otherwise action the absolute argument number
           <number>, with the first argument being 1.
           Specifying an argument before the first or after the last command
           line argument leaves $<number> un-massaged.
           By default, this command leaves the command-line argument pointer
           unchanged (so "Q $0" will return you to the file that "Q" last
           massaged into). "FM +#" reverses this behaviour so that the file you
           nominated in <number> becomes $0. "H FM" for more.
 File position
 The new edit starts with the file positioned at line 1.

This command gives the Q Editor its name. Although originally simply there to
quit the program, it has acquired much additional functionality over the years.
