Give symbolic names to ALU memory locations e.g. k,0,i^J^<POP i>
 Error if try to rename location
 Error if use same name twice
DONE(Q reg): New read-only ALU Y register for return values from Q
STARTED: 2 active pseudos to run a shell command and receive stdout/stderr (backtick)
 DONE: e.g. if n4014 & n4015
 DONE: n4014 {shell command} or n4015 {shell command}
 DONE: ^ND^N^<4014> returns stdout (minus final Nl)
 DONE: ^ND^N^<4015> returns stderr (minus final Nl)
 DONE: ^NM^<4014> (or <4015>) as above
 DONE: If defined as n4014, error in cmd => error in macro
 DONE: If defined as n4015, command status returned in Y (0=good), macro continues
 Update HELP
 Update man page(s)
DONE: New basic pseudo ^NW<macro id> return length of macro in Y; -1 if undefined
"q -l" to insert "fm +l" command before reading file
Search up directory tree for .qrc
Use .qrc associated with file to edit
Do Delete properly (not as an edit)
ALU is always 64-bit (?)
cater for >4G lines in L & Y
Give some kind of acknowledgement to ^NF (& ^NO?)
-H option to give invocation help
OBSOLETED BY ^NW Can test if a macro is defined: n4007 x; ^ND^N^<4007>
Can set actual amount for "1 line forward / back" half-page / full-page
Properly reinstate output optimisation (old hack removed as "quick fix")
 needs select() /poll()
 needs nanosleep when outputting chars
 needs circular(?) buffer for input chars
 get per-char delay from stty baud rate
 reinstate setting per-char delay (useful for testing)
INTERNALS
	STARTED: Have a bool enum for logicals
	STARTED: Fix runindent label squashes
	STARTED: More GIVE_UP macros - use error_exit as standard label
	STARTED: rework asg2 blocks (including xistcs.c)
	STARTED: Use meaningful names instead of logtemp &c.
	STARTED Tidy scmnrd.c in particular
	STARTED: Be more careful what goes to stderr / stdin
	STARTED: use stdint types
	DONE: buf is always a local; utility buffer is ubuf
Show what arguments Q started with (?)
STARTED: Catalogue of useful macros
New pseudomacro to replace "/*" with arbitrary seq: #, // &c (i.e. for ^O)
DONE: Retire ^NY (tab subtraction)
