man page for Q macros [ q_macros(5) ]
2 active pseudos to run a shell command and receive stdout/stderr (backtick)
 e.g. if n4014 & n4015
 n4014 {shell command} or n4015 {shell command}
 ^ND^N^<4014> returns stdout (minus final Nl)
 ^ND^N^<4015> returns stderr (minus final Nl)
 If defined as n4014, error in cmd => error in macro
 If defined as n4015, command status returned in X (0=good), macro continues
"q -l" to insert "fm +l" command before reading file
Search up directory tree for .qrc
Use .qrc associated with file to edit
Do Delete properly (not as an edit)
ALU is always 64-bit (?)
cater for >4G lines in L & Y
Give some kind of acknowledgement to ^NF (& ^NO?)
-H option to give invocation help
Can test if a macro is defined: n4007 x; ^ND^N^<4007>
Can set actual amount for "1 line forward / back" half-page / full-page
Properly reinstate output optimisation (old hack removed as "quick fix")
 needs select() /poll()
 needs nanosleep when outputting chars
 needs stack of command input buffers probably
 get per-char delay from stty baud rate
 reinstate setting per-char delay (useful for testing)
INTERNALS
	STARTED Have a bool enum for logicals
	STARTED: Fix runindent label squashes
	STARTED: More GIVE_UP macros - use error_exit as standard label
	STARTED: rework asg2 blocks (including xistcs.c)
	STARTED: Use meaningful names instead of logtemp &c.
	STARTED Tidy scmnrd.c in particular
	STARTED: Be more careful what goes to stderr / stdin
	use stdint types
Show what arguments Q started with (?)
STARTED: Catalogue of useful macros
New pseudomacro to replace "/*" with arbitrary seq: #, // &c (i.e. for ^O)
FQVERSN opcode to push Q version to F
