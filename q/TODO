Retire separate MACRO & HELP directories
README_DEBUG_ADVANCED to have table of useful variables
  ptrpos, tabs rs[], fs[], rsidx, fsidx, xreg, qreg
  curr, prev, oldcom, newcom
Mode to turn off line & part numbering (entire line selectable on V or P)
STARTED: Specify file for monitoring input (from any source)
Opcodes POPL & POPLF: pop to line being edited (command or file)
DONE: Opcode XMODE to set fmode from X-reg after command read (for ^N7)
Q -B to break long lines on token delimiter if length so far > 32(?)K
Give symbolic names to ALU memory locations e.g. k,0,i^J^<POP i>
 Error if try to rename location
 Error if use same name twice
command-line option to insert "fm +l" command before reading file
Search up directory tree for .qrc
Use .qrc associated with file to edit
ALU is always 64-bit (required for > 32 mode bits)
cater for >4G lines in L & Y
Give some kind of acknowledgement to ^NF (& ^NO?)
-H option to give invocation help
Can set actual amount for "1 line forward / back" half-page / full-page
Properly reinstate output optimisation (old hack removed as "quick fix")
 use ioctl TIOCOUTQ to get # chars waiting to go
 needs select() /poll() and/or ioctl FIONREAD
 needs nanosleep when outputting chars
 get per-char delay from stty baud rate
 reinstate setting per-char delay (useful for testing)
INTERNALS
	STARTED: Have a bool enum for logicals
	STARTED: Be more careful what goes to stderr / stdout
	STARTED: use stdint types
	STARTED: Reduce number of goto stmts
Show what arguments Q started with (?)
STARTED: Catalogue of useful macros
New pseudomacro to replace "/*" with arbitrary seq: #, // &c (i.e. for ^O)
