DONE: Do not visbell more than once every 1/10 sec
Add ~/bin/qm (list macros) to make install
Create man page for qm
DONE: q -v to not action FD Y
DONE: FB to use clock_gettime (replaces gettimeofday) for 1/5 second interval
FRecurse command to bring up q command line from w/in macro:
 Q continues macro; FQ abandons
Q -B to break long lines on token delimiter if length so far > 32(?)K
Give symbolic names to ALU memory locations e.g. k,0,i^J^<POP i>
 Error if try to rename location
 Error if use same name twice
"q -l" to insert "fm +l" command before reading file
Search up directory tree for .qrc
Use .qrc associated with file to edit
Do Delete properly (i.e. entirely inside workfile.c)
ALU is always 64-bit (?)
cater for >4G lines in L & Y
Give some kind of acknowledgement to ^NF (& ^NO?)
-H option to give invocation help
Can set actual amount for "1 line forward / back" half-page / full-page
Properly reinstate output optimisation (old hack removed as "quick fix")
 needs select() /poll()
 needs nanosleep when outputting chars
 needs stack of buffers per U-use [and F-freprompt] for input chars
 get per-char delay from stty baud rate
 reinstate setting per-char delay (useful for testing)
INTERNALS
	STARTED: Have a bool enum for logicals
	DONE: Fix runindent label squashes
	DONE: More GIVE_UP macros - use error_exit as standard label
	DONE: rework asg2 blocks (including xistcs.c)
	STARTED: Use meaningful names instead of logtmp &c.
	DONE: Tidy scmnrd.c in particular
	STARTED: Be more careful what goes to stderr / stdin
	STARTED: use stdint types
	DONE: Reduce number of goto stmts
	DONE: return bad_rdtk() once H & L are subroutinised
	DONE: Eliminate FTN COMMON in favour of extern / instantiate
	Re-organise q.c for static fns at end
	Maybe re-organise q.c for no internal fns
Show what arguments Q started with (?)
STARTED: Catalogue of useful macros
New pseudomacro to replace "/*" with arbitrary seq: #, // &c (i.e. for ^O)
