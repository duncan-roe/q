Q version 32 has proved to be very stable. There are plans for further enhancements, but the timescale for these is uncertain.
About the only new feature since the last release is the ability to insert the current date / time into the file you are editing. There have been some improvements to using Q in scripts (i.e. non-interactively). There is also a fix for segfault when the screen was wider than 500 characters.
The last few commits have been to documentation (no version bump).
