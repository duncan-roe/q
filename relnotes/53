Two major innovations:

- **make install** builds and installs Q to specified or default locations.
This is tested under a number of distributions: see INSTALL for details.
- Q now has a *man page* for the **q** command.

Release 53 is marked as pre-release because it is still missing:

* Q needs a *man page* for *q macros*

Other Highlights:

* Fixes issues 9 & 11
* Catalogue (.cat) files complete for *word* & *foundation* macro sets
* **make uninstall** removes everything (except any created directories)
* *~user* works wherever *~* used to
* Unary **!** pops to command level like in other programs
