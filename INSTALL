 Installation instructions for q
 ============ ============ === =

Q offers autoconf-style configurability without actually using autoconf.

The file "config.mak" sets default locations and features. To change from these,
either edit that file or supply values to *make*, e.g.:

 make PREFIX=/usr HELP_CMD="less -X" install

Additionally, items listed under the Features heading may be changed at (q) run
time by environment variables which are the item name prepended by Q_, e.g.

  export Q_HELP_CMD="less -X"

MACRO_DIR is treated specially in this regard: if it's the same as HELP_DIR then
it will stay the same as HELP_DIR when Q_HELP_DIR is in the environment but
Q_MACRO_DIR isn't.

Q's macro debugger requires that q is compiled with debug.

Q builds under Linux and Cygwin.

Q should build under any POSIX-compliant system with GNU make, but the author
hasn't had access to other formerly-supported platforms for a while to test
this. The Makefile needs GNU make (may be available as gmake especially on
Solaris). Vendors' compilers should be OK absent gcc: the code tries very hard
not to use gcc extensions. Non-ANSI compilers are no longer supported.
