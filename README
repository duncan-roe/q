Q is a line-orientated mostly WYSIWYG editor with a powerful macro facility.

Editor source is in q; macros and help files are in help.

Both these directories have .qrc files. You may like to copy one of them to your
home or current directory so Q runs with an extended macro set: they are
available from DOCDIR after "make install".

For most programming tasks, q/.qrc is a good starting point. It loads the
Foundation plus C macro sets. help/.qrc loads Foundation plus Word macro sets,
suitable for documents like this one. Absent ./.qrc or ~/.qrc, Q runs with the
Foundation macro set.
