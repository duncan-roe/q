.TH Q 1 "Nov 11 2018" "Misc commands" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
q \- line-orientated mostly WYSIWYG editor with a powerful macro facility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3q\f1 [\f3-AVbdemnoqt\f1] [\f3-i\f2 initial_macro\f1] [\f3+\f2line# file\f1]
[\f2file\f1[\f3:\f2line#\f1] [...]]
.br
\f2command\f1 [...] \f3| q \f1[\f3-bdntv\f1]\f3 -i\f2 initial_macro \f3|\f2
command\f1 [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3q\f1 is a command-driven line-oriented editor in which almost all the control
characters perform some editing function.
More complex functions are provided by macros.
.br
\f3q\f1 is always either in \f2edit mode\f1 or \f2 command mode\f1. In edit
mode, q is editing a line from the current file;
in command mode, q is building up the next command to execute.
Full editing is available in both modes.
.br
\f3q\f1 commands all abbreviate to 1 character except those starting \f3f\f1
which abbreviate to 2.
Command arguments are delineated by space or comma, with a pair of commas
denoting an empty argument.
Those commands that take the rest of the line as input treat any spaces
following the first as part of the argument.
A single quote turns off comma and space recognition until a matching single
quote or end of line.
Inside quoted text, a pair of quotes is interpreted as a single literal quote.
.br
\f3q\f1 commands are case-insensitive, as are \f3q\f1 \f3help\f1 topics.
The documentation generally refers to commands in upper case,
in the form \f2command abbreviation\f3-\f2full command name\f1
as in \f3H\f1-\f3HELP\f1 below.
.PP
\f3Startup file\f1
.RS 3
When \f3q\f1 starts, it reads commands from a startup file before accepting user
input.
These commands typically load macros and may set some modes (see \f3H FM\f1).
.br
\f3q\f1 first looks in the current working directory for a file named
\f3.qrc\f1.
If not found, it tries to open \f3~/.qrc\f1.
If that also fails then it reads the file \f3qrc\f1 in 
\f3/usr/local/etc\f1 or whatever was configured at build time.
.RE
.PP
\f3Command massaging\f1
.RS 3
Provided it has no quoted parts, \f3q\f1 will split off the first argument to a
command from the command if it can
(i.e. without the user needing to type the intervening space or comma).
It can do this for any command if the argument starts with a non-alphabetic
character and for all instances of the \f3!\f1 (shell) command.
For example, the command "p23" (print 23 lines) will be interpreted
(and displayed) as "p 23".
.RE
.PP
\f3Running q in a pipe\f1
.RS 3
When running in a pipe, \f3q\f1 accumulates data from stdin until end of file
before doing anything else.
On exit, \f3q\f1 writes the edited file to stdout.
The mandatory \f3-i\f1 command should not try to save the file.
stdin and / or stdout may be redirected from / to a file rather than a pipe:
the rule is that stdin and stdout must either both be a tty or both not be.
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
To see a description of all options, start \f3q\f1 and enter \f3H IQ\f1.
