  << ^ N G - O B E Y   I F   M A T C H >>

 This conditional pseudo tests the character at the cursor position ('H CP')
for equality with the next character in the macro and obeys the following 2
characters (which must be there, i.e. this pseudo must be followed by at least
3 chars) if equality is true. Mnemonic:- obey if Got next char.
 Example:
 A good example is the "DELETE THIS WORD" macro ^N^K in the sample macro set
/usr/q/scmacs (under Unix). Here it is:
 N K '^D^NA^NU^NG ^NS^N^K^D^NU ;Word delete
 There is no special provision for comments in the macro processor by the way,
but after an unconditional transfer of control (e.g. ^NU above) the rest of the
macro up to the maximum length (limited only by command line length, curently
(MAR 94) 2048) can be used for one.
 Anyway, the macro assumes the cursor is on the first character of a word, and
that you want to delete the word and the space following (there won't be a
space following the last word in a line of course).
 Here's how it works:-
  Delete the current char				   ^D
  If now at end of line, exit (no more to do)		   ^NA^NU
  If we're not now on a space, repeat above  ** EXAMPLE**  ^NG ^NS^N^K
  Delete this space and exit (finished) 		   ^D^NU
 Note the use of ^NS to reverse the sense of ^NG to 'obey the jump back if NOT
equals'.
