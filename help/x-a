Gets the character string to get the cursor to end-of-line (EOL) (i.e. the
rightmost character position on the screen). Q never displays a character in
this column, because of possible wraparound, but it may wish to leave the cursor
there. The old default method was to get to the start of the current line,
backspace to the end of the previous line, then linefeed. This worked for many
pre-Ansii serial terminals, but is optional behaviour in an xterm.

Q can't determine whether reverse-wrap is in effect, so this default is no more.
However Q can use an Ansii escape sequence to get to anywhere in the line with
only a few characters (4 for cc 1-9, 5 for 10-99, ...).

Format
 A <no. of chars>,<char1>,...
 <# chars> total # of chars to get to EOL. Optional - may be specified as 0 or
           ommitted (0 assumed). 0 => there is no fast get to EOL available.
 <char1>ff The octal character(s) to get the cursor to EOL. Single characters
           stand for themselves - octal numbers must be specified with at least
           2 digits. If less than <# chars> are specified, the remainder are
           filled with the backspace character.

Examples
 A            /* Terminal with no fast EOL sequence
 A 3,15,10,12 /* The old default. Can still be quicker than Ansii
              /* (e.g. to get to column before EOL).
 A 1,01       /* A terminal where ^A gets to EOL.
 A 6 15 33 [ 7 9 C /* Ansii sequence for 80-column terminal EOL
