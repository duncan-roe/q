  \/ L - L O C A T E \/
 Locates the specified string, then acts as a 'modify' on the line containing it
with the screen cursor initially at the start of its first occurrence in that
line. The search for the string starts at the current file position, and
proceeds forward through the file unless "fm +r" is in effect, in which case the
file is searched backwards.
 Format
 LOCATE <string>,<1st no. of lines>,<2nd no. of lines>,<1st pos'n>,<last pos'n>,
<match index>
 Parameters
 <string>    the string to be searched for. If it contains space, comma, '/*'
             or quote, it should be enclosed in quotes, and quotes in the
             string should be doubled-up. <string> must be specified.
 <# lines 1> # of lines to be searched for <string>. Optional - if ommitted the
             search is done to end of file, or start of file if "fm +r".
 <# lines 2> # of lines to modify (including line containing <string>) after
             a successful search. Optional - taken as 1 if not specified. The
             ESCape key can be used to terminate editing before this number of
             lines, if required.
 <1st pos'n> } Optionally specify the 1st and last positions in the line where
 <last  "  > } the string may start. Both same value => where string must be.
             } Rules same as for # of lines arguments. Defaults:-
             } <string> can start char 1 / can be up to last part of line.
 <match index> For regular expressions only (fm +g): specify on which match to
               leave the cursor. A value of 1 (the default) means the start of
               the whole RE; 2 means 1st reported subexpression match, 3 means
               2nd subexpression and so on. RE matching is "extended", as
               defined in POSIX.2. (See e.g. "man 7 regex").
               If 1st and/or last positions are specified, they apply to the
               indexed match.
 File position
 After a successful search, the file is positioned after the last line modified,
if searching forwards. If searching backwards, the file is left at the line
where the match occurred (a backwards search starts at the line before the
current one). After an unsuccessful search, the file position is unchanged.
