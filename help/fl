Functions exactly as L-LOCATE except that the string being searched for is
searched for as a TOKEN.

Format

Parameters

File Position

Notes
 A string is matched as a token if it is delimited on both sides by either
end-of-range (e.g. line start/end, 1st/last spec'd column to search) OR a
non-alphanumeric character that has not been declared to be a non-delimiting
character by the FT command (qv). Thus in ordinary text "his" would match into
the word "his" but not into the middle of "this".
 E.g. in a c program, i would match into (i), i=j, 'i' but not into ii. To stop
i matching into i=j, do an FT =. To stop i matching character i above, FT ''''.
