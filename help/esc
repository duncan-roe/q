  <> E S C - A B A N D O N <>

Abandons the editing of a data line. If the line was being modified, it reverts
to its previous state; if it was a new line ("A" or "I") it is discarded.
 ESC terminates an "A", "I", or "M" command: it is the only way of terminating
either of the first two. See also ^T.
 When inputting a command, ESC first acts as ^U, then resets INSERT mode and
finally enables ^R to reveal the full contents of the command buffer.
