  << ^ N [ - O B E Y   I F   F I L E   P O S   B E F O R E   T A B >>

 This pseudo macro is similar to ^NB ('H CN-B') except that the file position
('H FPOS') rather than cursor position is tested.
 Note
 For this and all pseudo macros that test or access file position, tabs that
are in the range of tabs defined by the T-TABSET command can't be used. Thus if
you have the default tabs 7&36 then ^N[1 or ^N[2 is illegal (rings bell and
quits macro).
