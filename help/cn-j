  << ^ N J - L O N G   J U M P >>

Jumps by the arbitrary number of chars which is the value of the next character.
A backwards jump may be effected by specifying 16-bit 2's-complement
e.g. fi ^<PS2>xyz^<S1>^<SGT>^NL^NJ^<177764>Xabc^<POPN> outputs xyzxyzabc

Because this is a 3-character sequence, ^NL will be required to conditionally
obey it. The 4th character position is therefore lost, since either the ^NL or
the ^NJ will skip it. Conventionally such positions are coded with an X (Capital
"X").

The skip is done relative to the character following the macro (e.g. capital "X"
above). Simple example:-

...^NL^NJ^<06>X^[m-2^J...

conditionally obeys the 5-character sequence  starting with ^[ (assuming ^NL was
preceded by a conditional like ^NA returning false).

There are more examples in the distributed C macro set 'c.qm' typically
installed in /usr/share/q
