 Many commands take one of these - some take two. They are always optional and
so can be omitted or specified as null in either of which cases they take their
default values. Defaults vary from command to command - see individual
specifications (i.e. do a "HELP" on the individual commands). The most common
default is 1 i.e. do whatever was specified for the specified line only.
Greater than 1 means 'do it for that # of lines starting at the specified
line'. As is the case with PRIME's editor, a larger number than the number of
lines to the end of the file may be specified in which case a message is output
when end-of-file is reached, the command then terminating normally. However the
number must be within the capacity of a 16-bit word i.e. <32K.
 Another format is available, but will be found to be of use chiefly within
screenedit macros. Rather than giving a decimal number, give the letter 'T'
followed by a single character identifying one of the 20 possible tab positions
(these are listed under the ASCII reference table - H AS for details). Then the
value in that tab becomes the numeric argument. Thus you could Locate a string
between the positions defined by tabs 1 & 2 by a command of the form:
 L <string>,,,T1,T2
 -TO format
 It is also usually possible, when a real # of lines is being specified (i.e.
not a column position) to use the construct "-TO <line #>", where -TO can be
abbreviated to -T or -. The inclusive # of lines to the specified line from the
last sensible line # given is how this is interpreted. E.g:-
 DELETE 537 -TO 600
