  << ^ N Y - D O   S U B T R A C T I O N >>

 This pseudo gives you the "locate until line containing" facility, only more
so. Remembering that T<tab-id> is a legal format for # of lines argument,
choose 3 consecutive tabs (the 1st of which must obey the note in ^N[ ('H
CN-LHB'), remember your current position in the first tab, look ahead using any
rules you like for the first line you DON'T want to search, remember its
position in the 2nd tab, do a ^NY<1st tab-id> to get the # of lines between
these two in the 3rd tab. Now move back to your original position and use
"T<3rd tab-id>" as the # of lines argument to L-LOCATE or whatever command you
were going to use.
 Note
 Read the topics on ^NF & ^NN especially the notes with ^NF ('H CN-F','H CN-N')
