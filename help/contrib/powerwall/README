powerwall.qm - massage Tesla powerwall csv files for smooth-line PDF graph

powerwall.qm is designed to operate on a 1-day battery data download from the
Tesla app. The macros shorten entries in the date/time colum and coerce the
Energy Remaining column to be suitable for a smoooth-line graph.

The POW shell script runs q to edit the csv then invokes LibreOffice for the
graphics. Actually getting the graph is a manual process detailed below.

In detail: the Date time column has entries like 2022-10-20T00:00:00+11:0.
Shorten this to "00:00" and replace the heading with the date e.g."2022-10-20"
from the above. Double quotes are there so we don't have to change cell format
from default.

Change the Energy Remaining heading to Bat chg (%/20). Energy Remaining is only
logged every 15 min so interpolate at 5 minute intervals to match the other
measurements and divide all entries by 20 (so 100% charge has same y cordinate
as 5KW).

POW invokes LibreOffice on the edited csv. Hit <Enter> in the Import dialog. To
get the PDF to be an exact number of pages you will want the printing page grid.
Turn this on by Print Preview (Ctrl-Shift-O) followed by ESC. Cell A1 should
still be selected, so a graph now will plot all available data. Click on the
Insert Chart tool icon then in the Chart Type dialog click Line, Lines Only and
Finish. Reposition and resize the chart to taste, the click File, Export as PDF.
Hit <Enter> in the following 2 dialogs. To end the LibreOffice session, click on
a cell then enter Ctl-W. Answer Don't Save to the Confirm dialog (the csv is not
changed).

To delete a graph, first de-delect it (by selecting a cell) then click on the
graph *once* and hit DEL. To re-select a graph for moving &c., double-click on
it.
