INTRODUCTION

This directory contains contributed Q macro suites.

Anyone can contribute new suites. Open a github issue to contribute.

CONTRIBUTION FORMAT

The preferred format is a directory containing at least the macro suite in a .qm
file and a README. It may contain other files, such as a shell script that uses
the macro suite.

The other accepted format is a bare .qm file starting with comments that
document what it does and how to use it.

CATALOGUE OF CONTRIBUTIONS

cpp.qm: Enable viewing of pre-processed C code, but only from the .c files (i.e.
w/out the copious output from the .h files). The suite caters for 1 level of
including other .c files: at least one project does this to implement something
approaching C++-style template functions.

mail/mail.qm: Prune MTA-inserted headers from an mbox, for subsequent viewing
with `less`.

powerwall/powerwall.qm: Prepare a battery energy csv file downloaded from the
Tesla app for LibreOffice to make a smooth-line graph. The powerwall/POW script
runs Q and LibreOffice. powerwall/README details what to do in LibreOffice.
