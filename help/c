Copies lines from 1 part of the file to another.

Format
 COPY <line no.>,<line no.>,<no. of lines>

Parameters
 1st <line no.> Line # of 1st line to be copied. must be specified.

                Must be specified.
 <no. of lines> # of lines to copy. Optional - taken as 1 if ommitted

Special uses
 The file addresses are calculated before the copy is done, then lines are read
and written sequentially. Thus if fields overlap, duplication will occur. eg:
 'C 1,2,1000' will make 1000 copies of line 1, starting at line 2 (assuming at
              least 2 lines in the file).

File position
 The file is left after the last line created
