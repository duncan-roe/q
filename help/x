  \/ X - C H A R A C T E R I S T I C S \/

Sets terminal characteristics, e.g. if the defaults are unsuitable. Screenedit
mode is disabled (it is, after all, unreliable until the terminal
characteristics are established) then characteristics commands are read,
terminated by another "X".

Parameters: none

Notes
 HELP on individual characteristics commands is available seperately by typing
"H X-<xistics command>". A list of these follows:
 A-end of line sequence                  B-backspace availability or value
 D-set or display per-character delay    W-Assume VT100 / X-Window eol seq
 R-carriage return sequence              T- set spaces per tab
 X-exit back to main editor
 Example
 The most common use of this command is probably to set the "spaces per tab"
value in conjunction with asserting FM +L. This gives you a file with 1 tab per
indent level where you see your choice of tab width when editing.
 X
 T 4
 X
 Sets tab width 4.
 The X command may be invoked from within a macro, but when it is in effect,
macro expansion is not active. Therefore the leading and trailing X must both be
in the same macro if the macro is a subroutine, because X will not action ^NU.
 Similarly if an X command starts in a U-USE file it must also finish there,
because X will not action Z. (Q actually forces an X and then forces a Z in this
case).
