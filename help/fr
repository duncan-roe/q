Prompts user for action in the middle of a macro

Parameters: none

 FR is designed to be used by a macro when it encounters a situation which it
doesn't know how to deal with.
 The user takes whatever action is required and then lets the macro continue by
entering the Q-QUIT command. Or, if say no remedy is available, the FQ command
will terminate the macro much as if the macro had encountered an error.

 FR may only be issued from within a macro. In that macro, it must be followed
by ^J (not ^T).
 The above are the only constraints. FR works when Q is running in a pipe or
with the -o (offline) option. When FR is invoked, the user is invited to
 "Type Q to continue macro xxx; FQ to abandon", where xxx is the number of the
invoking macro (in octal, as macros are defined).

Example use of FR:

 The (case-insensitive) command H C.QM browses the macros for writing C code.
The indented part of the comment block starting '# n 1   "beautify" C source'
describes how FR is used by the N1 (N061) macro suite.
