Erases all characters to the left of the cursor, which is then at col 1. Has no
effect if at col 1 already.

Indenting
 If the cursor is not at the indent point, for 'col 1' above read 'the indent
point'. However if the cursor is at the indent point the indent itself is
killed, leaving the cursor (and the indent point) at col 1.
