  \/ U - U S E F I L E \/

Instructs Q to make the nominated file its standard input. The current standard
input is resumed when input from the file finishes. File input finishes on
error, the "Z" command, or end of file.

Parameter
 <pathname> Name of command file. Must be specified.

Notes
 - If "Z" is missing from the end of the file, Q will silently insert it.
   Hence you don't really need to use Z, but it can be handy e.g. to append
   documentation (as is done in scmacs.w)
 - If Q reports an unhandled error while obeying a Used file, the entire file
   stack is unwound and standard input reverts to the original source.
 - Output suppression (by "fd y") is inherited from an invoking Use file. On
   returning to an outer Use file, the suppression setting is restored to what
   it was when it U-Used this file.
 - USEFILE is typically used to load Q's macros.
