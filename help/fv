Sets the output level on macros &c. to maximum possible

Parameters: none

 Normally when using screenedit macros, which are in fact purely interpretive,
you see all the commands and amended lines generated, as if the input had come
from the keyboard. This is VERBOSE mode, as set by this command, and is the
default when editing is started. Certain macros which are almost small
"programs" may cause rather a lot of output so commands are available to reduce
the amount sent to the screen - these being FBrief and FNone.
 This mode setting can also affect output from the Ychangeall command which
normally outputs every amended line.
