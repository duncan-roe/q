In indent mode a new line replicates the leading whitespace of the previous line
before accepting any input. The cursor is then said to be at the 'indent point'
(I.P.). When modifying an existing line, the I.P. is set at the first
non-whitespace character in the line. When at the I.P., there are three ways to
move it:
 1. move it further into the line by entering spaces, tabs &c. whether inserting
or not;
 2. move it back 1 character by keying DEL (if indenting by tab characters this
removes one of them);
 3. Remove the entire indent by keying ^L (left-hand kill).

Other modified control char action
 ^B & ^Y will not move the cursor to before the I.P.; ^H returns to the I.P.; ^U
erases everything after the I.P.; ^L from other than the I.P. erases back to it.
