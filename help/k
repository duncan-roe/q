K by itself closes the current keylog file, subject to confirmation.

"K -" displays what the current keylog file is.

"K {filename}" closes the current keylog file (if any) and starts logging to
{file}

Logging is always to the end of a file.

A keylog file is a file or tty to which Q logs received keysterokes. With the
default FM -8, only actual keystrokes are logged. With FM +8, Q logs
"keystrokes" from macros and U-USEFILE files as well.

Logging behaviour is also affected by modes 9 & 0: see "H FM".
