  \/ F I - I M M E D I A T E _ M A C R O \/

Defines a new macro to be obeyed immediately.

This command enables access to any macro from the keyboard or a U-USE file. FI
macros have a small stack, (currently 16) and use macros N101 (macro 65)
onwards.
 Parameter
 <macro text> The unquoted definition (as if defined using N-NEWMACRO with a
              macro id of 3 or more octal digits) ("h n" gives more details).
 Q's -i option generates an FI command.
