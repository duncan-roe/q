  << ^ N N - S E T   F I L E   P O S I T I O N >>

 Position the file at the value in the tab indicated by the following character
in the macro (which must be there and be a valid tab i.d.). The tab is checked
as follows: it must have previously been set and must be whithin range (<= # OF
LINES IN FILE + 1). Failure of any of these checks results in error action: the
bell rings, macro mode is quitted, and stack is emptied.
 Type 'H AS' for a list of the valid tab id's.
 Notes
 Use this pseudomac in conjunction with ^NF. Read the notes with ^NF ('H CN-F')
very carefully to use this pair of pseudos successfully.
 Ordinarily, you must be in command mode when issuing this pseudo-macro. This
is because the main editor does not expect the file position to move while
editing a line and does not check if it has. When a modified line comes back it
just deletes the line before the file position (i.e. the line it has just read)
and inserts before the file position the modified line it has just got back.
Thus if the file pointer moves, a competely different line will be overwritten
by the modified line. If for some perverse reason you actually want to do this
you can - by issuing ^NT ('H CN-T') first but be warned - you are on your own
and positioning to line 1 will certainly cause problems.
