  <> D E L  [ R U B O U T ]  -  D E L E T E   P R E V I O U S <>

Deletes the character before the cursor (e.g. a char just typed). Illegal if
cursor at column 1 - rings bell.

Indenting
 If rubout is issued at the indent point, a space is erased from the indent
zone and the indent point moves back 1. See also ^L.

To cancel ^N
 DEL will cancel a preceding ^N, if you change your mind about invoking a
macro. DEL also cancels ^N^W (invoke extended-character-set macro).
