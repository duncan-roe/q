Q contains an ALU to enable macros to execute small general-purpose programs.
The emulated processor is stack-based with 512 memory locations, and direct
access to Q's tabs. It has one main register stack (R) currently 16 deep, and an
index register (X). Instructions can cause a skip of the next 2 charatcters in
the invoking macro, in the same way as ^NS does.

Macros 7000 - 7777 implement the memory locations. These macros may be defined
using N-NEWMACRO or ^NM^<7xxx>, and retrieved using ^ND^N^<7xxx>. When using
N-NEWMACRO to define a 7xxx macro, do not code ^NU after the number.

Instructions are pseudomacros, but one should always code them using their
symbolic opcodes, because the relationship between opcode and macro number can
change between revisions of Q.

When coding a symbolic opcode, do *not* code a preceding ^N.
