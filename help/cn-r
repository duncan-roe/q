  << ^ N R - S E T   C U R S O R   P O S I T I O N >>

 Moves the cursor to the value in the tab indicated by the following character
in the macro (which must be there and be a valid tab i.d.). The tab is checked
as follows: it must have previously been set and must be whithin range (<=line
length+1). Failure of any of these checks results in error action: the bell
rings, macro mode is quitted, and stack is emptied.
 Type 'H AS' for a list of the valid tab id's.
