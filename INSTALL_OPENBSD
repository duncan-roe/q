These notes are for OpenBSD 7.2

The supplied 'make' will not work: you need to use gmake (GNU make):

# pkg_add gmake

BEFORE RUNNING GMAKE
====== ======= =====

I found it easier to edit config.mak rather than supply extra args to gmake.
This patch puts the man pages where the man command can find them:

You should also patch ggdb before installing, in case you ever want to run the
macro debugger:

You can use the 'patch' command to apply both of the above:

$ patch <INSTALL_OPENBSD

Now you can run:

# CFLAGS=-Og gmake install

Be wary of substituting e.g. -O2 for -Og. The installed compiler (Clang)
ignores the GCC pragma that turns off optimising in workfile.c.
The pragma is there because I've had trouble with optimising that code at some
GCC versions.

BEFORE RUNNING THE MACRO DEBUGGER
====== ======= === ===== ========

The gdb that comes with OpenBSD 7.2 fails to load Q's symbol table.
Get a newer one by:

# pkg_add gdb

The new gdb is called egdb. The above patch took care of the name change.
ggdb is copied from command_line_tools. Even if you have installed
command_line_tools, you may like to:

$ ln -s /usr/local/share/doc/q/ggdb ~/bin/

or patch the copy in command_line_tools.

ggdb uses expect:

# pkg_add expect
